# RIF Lumino node WEB

![Lumino Network](Lumino.png?raw=true "RIF Lumino Network")


## Pre requisites

1. RIF Lumino Node Running
2. Yarn (Latest Version)
3. NodeJS v12.20.2

## Recomended usage

The RIF Lumino Client comes with a production build of the Lumino node Web that shows up when the node starts. This repository includes the source code of that build and is intended to developers that want to make changes. 

If you don't plan to modify the source code, please use the production build.



## Build RIF Lumino WEB from code

1. Get the code by cloning this repo
2. Go to the path you downloaded or cloned Lumino's code (lets call this path `$RIF_LUMINO_WEB_PATH`)

3. Run ```yarn install```

## Start your RIF Lumino Node WEB

1. Go to `$RIF_LUMINO_WEB_PATH`
2. Run the following command:

```
REACT_APP_NODE_ADDRESS=$RSK_ADDRESS REACT_APP_NODE_RNS_DOMAIN=$RNS_ADDRESS yarn start
```

| FIELD                                   | DESCRIPTION                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$RSK_ADDRESS`                          | The RSK address asigned to your RIF Lumino Node                                                  |
| `$RNS_ADDRESS`                           | The RNS domain asociated with your RSK node Address                                     |

Note: You can start the web without specifying `$RNS_ADDRESS` if your Lumino node is not registered into RNS. 


3.  After you run yarn command you will be presented with the following message:

```
yarn run $YOUR_YARN_VERSION
$ react-scripts start
Starting the development server...
Compiled successfully!

You can now view RIF-Lumino in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://$YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_MACHINE:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```
